# Bachelor's Project: Reproducing WikiSP

## A detailed explanation on what this project accomplishes can be found in the corresponding [blog-post](https://ad-blog.cs.uni-freiburg.de/post/reproducing-wikisp/).

## Usage

In order to make use of my work yourself, first clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ludraaa/Bachelorprojekt.git
cd Bachelorprojekt
```

For ease of use, a docker image is provided. The commands to both build and run this can be found at the bottom of the `Dockerfile`. You should first take a look at `SETUP.md`. All direct information of what you need to do to use this project can be found in there.

Note: It is technically possible to run this outside of the docker container, but you will have to set up the VENVs yourself. As such, use of the Dockerfile is highly recommended.
